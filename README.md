# 09project-sk
A tale of misfortune in the form of some bad Minecraft server script files (2020-2021)

# Disclaimer

These are merely for educational purposes on what NOT to do when making a Minecraft server. I'd recommend learning Java instead of using a scripting plugin like this, even though I'm a massive idiot when it comes to real programming. The use of these scripts is not recommended and most likely won't work properly. Skript requires a beast of a server to parse scripts with minimal lag.

# About

These are scripts I created for the 09project 1.8.8 Minecraft server from February 2020 to November 2021, parsed by the Skript plugin. These scripts are horribly unoptimized and only function because of the heaps of hot glue and duct tape I put on it.
